# Social Single Sign-On (SSO) Implementation
This repository provides a complete implementation of Social Single Sign-On (SSO) using popular OAuth2 providers such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub. It includes backend authentication logic, token management, and session handling for secure and seamless user login.

The project is built with FastAPI and includes integrations for external OAuth2 providers, allowing users to sign in using their existing social media accounts. Additional user data can be captured during the sign-in process, such as profile preferences or location information.

Features include:
- OAuth2 integration with Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
- Secure session management and token validation.
- Custom form fields for capturing additional user data during sign-in.
- Backend authentication flow for seamless integration with frontend frameworks.

This repo is ideal for projects that need quick and secure user authentication with minimal setup using external identity providers.
